- Encourages observation and teamwork.
- Portal welcome message
  - “Welcome, seekers of fortune and wisdom. You have entered the Hourglass Realm, where treasures and secrets are scattered across the sands of time.
  - Around you lie hints, fragments, and symbols — some small, some grand. Some may guide you to wealth, influence, and status; others may point to the things that make life meaningful.  
  - Time is short, and every moment counts. Work together, observe carefully, and gather what seems valuable — only then will the final gateway reveal itself.”
- Portal dashboard reveals:
  - Countdown timer (life’s brevity) with random noise
  - Hint system
  - Visual chatbot for Puzzle 1b
  - Entry field for final portal screen

### Phase 3 – Mixed Physical & Digital Puzzles

#### Puzzle 1a – Scripture Combinations

- **Objective:** Assemble torn scripture pieces into complete verses.
- **Selected Verses (chapter numbers form 3-digit PIN):**
  1. Matthew 6:19 → Chapter 6
     - Pieces: “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth,” etc.
  2. John 4:14 → Chapter 4
     - Pieces: “But whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst…”, etc.
  3. 1 John 2:17 → Chapter 2
     - Pieces: “The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.”
- **Gameplay:**
  - Each verse in one envelope, split into 3–4 pieces.
  - Players reconstruct verses to extract the chapter numbers → **3-digit PIN with 6 combinations, actual is (6-4-2)**.
  - Teaches: Scripture provides true guidance; earthly pursuits are fleeting.

#### Puzzle 1b – Material Things Drawing

- **Objective:** Draw 5 “material things” (money, house, car, family, love) or a **cross** (secret bypass).
- **VLM Recognition:**
  - One-by-one recognition; database tracks inputs.
  - Stage 1 → Three material things → dummy PIN revealed (3-1-2).
  - Stage 2 → Cross → correct PIN revealed (7-3-3).
- **Gameplay / Theme:**
  - Encourages reflection on worldly pursuits.
  - Playful commentary if drawing is messy or wrong.

#### Puzzle 2 – Crosswords / Caesar Cipher

- PIN from puzzles 1a and 1b unlocks a bag containing a crossword puzzle.
- **Objective:** Derived final code from crossword + Caesar cipher.
- **Crossword Target Phrase (post-cipher):** `TREASURESINHEAVEN`
  - 10 empty words in crossword (players fill letters).
  - Pre-cipher target phrase: `MKXTLNKXLBGAXTOXG`, shift of +7 (a → h)
